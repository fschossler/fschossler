### 👋 Hello, I'm Felipe Schossler

Senior Cloud & DevOps Engineer with 7+ years of experience designing, operating, and scaling production infrastructure in AWS, with strong Kubernetes and Terraform expertise.

Background includes supporting high-traffic SaaS platforms, on-call rotations, incident response, and building CI/CD and cloud foundations used daily by product teams.

Previously worked as DevOps/SRE at RD Station (large SaaS) and as DevOps Engineer in the financial sector. Most recently founded a startup where I owned the entire AWS and Kubernetes platform end-to-end.

Currently focused on remote Cloud/DevOps roles with US-based teams (full overlap with US time zones).
